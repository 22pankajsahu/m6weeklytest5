## Features

- Displays the current month, day, date, and year.
- Minimalistic design with a clean user interface.
- Easy to read and access date-related information.

## How it Works

The Mini Calendar web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure defines the elements that make up the Mini Calendar:

- A `calendar-container` div element to hold the date-related information.
- Paragraph elements with distinct IDs (`month-name`, `day-name`, `day-number`, `year`) to display the month, day, date, and year.

### CSS Styling

The CSS styles define the visual appearance of the Mini Calendar:

- A centered and styled `calendar-container` with a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow.
- Stylish formatting for the month, day, date, and year elements to make them visually appealing and easy to read.

### JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code retrieves the current date using the `Date` object and sets the content of the HTML elements with corresponding IDs. It utilizes the `toLocaleDateString` method to format the date and day in a user-friendly way.
